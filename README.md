# FlightFinder
There is a reported phenomenon where hotel and flight prices (among other things) differ when using a vpn to appear to be in a different country.
This is a project to automate a search for flights, perform that search iterating through VPNs in different countries, and generate a report concerning the prices returned--highlighting any differences.
